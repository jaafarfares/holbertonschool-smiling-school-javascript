This is a JavaScript project that requires the use of HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive Design/Bootstrap/Javascript to build fully functional web pages, the goal is to clone UI/UX designer pages. The project requires the use of Bootstrap, JQuery, Google fonts, and CSS/JS from Bootstrap CDN. The CSS file "styles.css" should be kept as small as possible, and all the Javascript code should be written in "scripts.js" and executed only when the document is loaded. The project consists of two tasks:

Reuse and polish the Bootstrap integration - reuse and finalize the design of three pages (homepage.html, pricing.html, courses.html) and make the final result match the given screens.



##### example

Homepage - quotes - replace the static quotes in homepage.html with dynamic quotes loaded from an API (https://smileschool-api.hbtn.info/quotes) using Ajax requests. A loader should be displayed during the request. The carousel should work like before, and the pages should switch to tablet or mobile versions when the screen width is changed.



## Ajax

Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. It allows a web page to update just part of the page without reloading the entire page. This is achieved by making asynchronous requests to a server using JavaScript, avoiding the need to refresh the entire page. The data retrieved from the server can be in XML, JSON or plain text format, which can then be processed and displayed on the page as needed. Ajax can be used to build rich and interactive web applications and to communicate with a server in the background, without blocking the user interface
